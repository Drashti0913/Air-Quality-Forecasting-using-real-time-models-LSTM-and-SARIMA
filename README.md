# AirQualityForecasting
With the growing urbanization and industrialization, air quality has become a critical concern.
Prolonged exposure to polluted air leads to severe health issues, including respiratory and
cardiovascular diseases. This project aims to develop a reliable forecasting mechanism for air
pollution, utilizing the Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA)
model and deep learning models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).With the growing urbanization and industrialization, air quality has become a critical concern.

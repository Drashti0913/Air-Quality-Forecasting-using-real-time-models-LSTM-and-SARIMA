##Air Quality Prediction using LSTM and SARIMA

Description
This project involves predicting air quality using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models. The aim is to forecast air pollution levels and provide actionable insights for environmental management.

Key Features
Combined LSTM and SARIMA models for accurate air quality forecasting.
Real-time data processing and prediction.
Visualization of air quality trends and predictions.
